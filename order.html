	<div style="display: inline-block; width: 50%; height: 200px;">
		Basically, writing software (computer programs) involves describing processes, procedures; it involves the authoring of algorithms.  Computer programming involves developing lists of instructions - the source code representation of software  The stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects, e.g., numbers, words, images, sounds, etc...  Creating a computer program can be like composing music, like designing a house, like creating lots of stuff.  It has been argued that in its current state it is an art, not engineering.
